# CDP Support Agent Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project is a chatbot that helps users find answers to "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from the official documentation of these platforms and provides the user with step-by-step guidance.

- **Extract Information from Documentation**: The chatbot can navigate through the official documentation of each platform and extract relevant instructions.
- **Handle Variations in Questions**: The chatbot handles variations in phrasing and terminology.
- **Bonus Features**:
  - **Cross-CDP Comparison**: The chatbot can compare functionalities between the platforms.
